Sprint 1: Created the basic layout of my Portfolio. Added the required folders and wrote basic code.
Review: After reviewing it with my Professor, I got the feeback that the project should have more Tailwind CSS and more interactivity.
Sprint 2: Removed two folders which were excluded from my plan and added two new folders. 
Sprint 3: After the feeback by professor I made many major changes to code and used Tailwind CSS and add basic interacitivity. I have completed my project and it is ready for the professor to check out and grade.
